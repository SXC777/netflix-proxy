# about
`netflix-proxy` is a smart DNS proxy to stream `Netflix`, `Hulu`[[n2]](#footnotes), `HBO Now` and others out of region. It is deployed using Docker containers and uses `dnsmasq`[[n18]](#footnotes) and `sniproxy`[[n1]](#footnotes) to provide SmartDNS services. It works for some blocked sites, such as [PornHub](http://www.pornhub.com/) and [YouTube](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_of_YouTube_videos_in_Germany).
